This Uniy Project has been interfaced with YARP and is capable of transmiting and recveiving images as well as bottles.

Unity Proect also includes a prototype icub to be used for simulation purposes.

Contents of the Assets/Plugins folder are the key to the integration.

The files here are the .cs files generated by compiling yarp with c sharp support and are the same wheter files are compiled in ubuntu or in windows.
